## Development Environment

- `dev.sh` needs work. Especially, what happens when I run it from a remote workstation? Could be difficult to then find and kill the new terminals. Need a way to kill those processes on demand.
  - Maybe after launching everything, have the process continue to run. When the process is killed, kill the spawned child processes... Don't really know how to do any of that at the moment.
