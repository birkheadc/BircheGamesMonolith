# TODO

- Rethink form "working-overlay"
  - What about large forms that the user scrolls through? Where should the spinner go?
  - Instead, "working" should be handled by root, maybe a darken the screen, disable input, and unhide a spinner in the center of the screen

- Work on standard form css
  - Move more of the styles from account form into standard form

- Work on account page
  - Validate display name and tag, color labels when not good.

- Get better resolution version of / new icon
