# BircheGames

This is the monolith repo for my new site Birche Games. The site will be a place to host games I've made. Browser based games can be played here, native games can be downloaded.

User registration and user authentication APIs will also be built. Registered users can create comments, but more importantly use their account to join multiplayer games.
